The linear span of uniform matrix product states

The variety of uniform matrix product states arises both in algebraic geometry as a natural generalization of the Veronese variety, and in quantum many-body physics as a model for a translation-invariant system of sites placed on a ring. Using methods from linear algebra, representation theory, and invariant theory of matrices, we study the linear span of this variety.
